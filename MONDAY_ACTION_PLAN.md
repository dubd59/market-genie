# üö® MONDAY ACTION PLAN - Market Genie Emergency Fixes
**Date: November 3, 2025**
**Status: CRITICAL - Firestore Connection Issues**

## üî• IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (Monday Morning)

### 1. **FIRESTORE CONNECTION CRISIS** ‚ö°
**Problem:** Massive WebChannel transport errors preventing ALL database saves
```
[2025-10-31T22:25:07.212Z] @firebase/firestore: WebChannelConnection RPC 'Write' stream transport errored
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **Check Firebase console for service outages/issues**
- [ ] **Review Firestore security rules** - may be blocking writes
- [ ] **Test with Firebase emulator locally** to isolate network vs config issues
- [ ] **Implement connection retry logic** with exponential backoff
- [ ] **Add Firestore connection health monitoring**

### 2. **API INTEGRATION STATUS** ‚úÖ (WORKING)
**Good News:** Prospeo API is 100% functional!
- ‚úÖ API Key: `f5526d834d7ad4eba595ddee37494a27` (61 credits)
- ‚úÖ Firebase proxy working
- ‚úÖ Email discovery: 40% success rate (4/10 leads found)

**Found Emails:**
- mathilde@frontapp.com
- nathanlatka@founderpath.com  
- chris@mooreinsurance.com
- sarah@boutiqueconsulting.com

## üìã DETAILED MONDAY TASKS

### **Phase 1: Database Emergency (9-11 AM)**
```bash
# Test commands to run Monday morning:
node checkDatabase.js                    # Verify basic connection
firebase emulators:start --only firestore # Test locally
node testApiKeyDirect.cjs               # Confirm API still working
```

**Diagnostics to check:**
1. **Firestore Rules** - Current rules may be too restrictive
2. **Network connectivity** - Could be ISP/DNS issues
3. **Firebase project limits** - Check quotas/billing
4. **Security bypass mode** - Currently activated but not helping

### **Phase 2: Lead Save Recovery (11 AM - 1 PM)**
The bulk scraper found emails but NONE saved to database due to connection errors.

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Extract leads from console logs** (already captured in logs above)
2. **Implement offline queue** for failed saves
3. **Add database write retries** with circuit breaker
4. **Test manual lead creation** to isolate bulk vs single save issues

### **Phase 3: Production Stabilization (2-4 PM)**
1. **Deploy connection fixes** to https://market-genie-f2d41.web.app
2. **Test end-to-end flow** with 2-3 manual leads
3. **Monitor error rates** in production
4. **Document the incident** and prevention measures

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION PRIORITIES

### **Firebase Configuration Check**
```javascript
// Test these in browser console Monday:
// 1. Check Firebase config
console.log(firebase.app().options);

// 2. Test basic Firestore write
const testWrite = async () => {
  try {
    await firebase.firestore().collection('test').add({
      timestamp: new Date(),
      test: 'connection'
    });
    console.log('‚úÖ Write successful');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Write failed:', error);
  }
};
testWrite();
```

### **Network Troubleshooting**
- [ ] Test from different network (mobile hotspot)
- [ ] Check DNS resolution for Firebase endpoints
- [ ] Verify firewall/antivirus not blocking Firebase
- [ ] Test with VPN enabled/disabled

### **Firestore Rules Investigation**
Current rules may be blocking writes. Check:
```javascript
// In firestore.rules - verify these patterns exist:
match /MarketGenie_tenants/{tenantId} {
  allow read, write: if isAuthenticated();
  
  match /leads/{leadId} {
    allow create, update: if isAuthenticated(); // ‚Üê This might be missing
  }
}
```

## üö® EMERGENCY CONTACTS & RESOURCES

### **If Firebase is completely down:**
1. **Backup plan:** Use local JSON storage temporarily
2. **Alternative:** Implement Supabase as fallback database
3. **Quick fix:** CSV export functionality for manual backup

### **Files Modified Today (All Safely Committed):**
- ‚úÖ `integrationService.js` - API integration working
- ‚úÖ `BulkProspeoScraper.jsx` - Found the connection issue
- ‚úÖ `testApiKeyDirect.cjs` - Diagnostic tools created
- ‚úÖ `recovered-prospeo-leads-2025-10-31.csv` - Backup of found leads

## üìû ESCALATION PATH

**If issues persist beyond Monday:**
1. **Contact Firebase Support** - Potential service issue
2. **Consider database migration** - This level of instability is concerning
3. **Implement offline-first architecture** - Queue all writes locally first

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS METRICS FOR MONDAY

**Minimum Viable Fix:**
- [ ] 1 lead can be saved manually without errors
- [ ] Bulk scraper saves at least 3/5 test leads
- [ ] No WebChannel transport errors for 30 minutes

**Ideal Outcome:**
- [ ] All 4 found emails successfully saved to database
- [ ] Bulk scraper running at 70%+ success rate
- [ ] Production monitoring showing stable connections
- [ ] Documentation updated with incident learnings

## üéØ **BOTTOM LINE FOR MONDAY**
**The API integration is PERFECT** - emails are being found successfully. The entire problem is the Firestore connection layer failing catastrophically. This is a database connectivity issue, not an API issue.

**Your mantra Monday:** *"The API works, the database doesn't. Fix the database."*
