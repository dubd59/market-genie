## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Development Server Won't Start**
- **Check Node Version**: Ensure Node.js 18+
- **Clear Cache**: Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install`
- **Port Conflicts**: Change port in `vite.config.js`
- **Permission Issues**: Run with appropriate permissions

#### **Build Failures**
- **Memory Issues**: Increase Node memory limit
- **TypeScript Errors**: Fix type errors or disable strict mode
- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all packages are installed
- **Environment Variables**: Verify all required env vars are set

#### **Voice Commands Not Working**
- **Browser Support**: Ensure Web Speech API support
- **Permissions**: Allow microphone access
- **HTTPS Required**: Voice API requires secure connection
- **Language Settings**: Check browser language settings

#### **3D Visualization Issues**
- **WebGL Support**: Verify browser WebGL capabilities
- **Graphics Drivers**: Update graphics card drivers
- **Performance**: Reduce quality settings for older devices
- **Memory Limits**: Monitor memory usage on mobile devices

### **Performance Optimization**

#### **Frontend Performance**
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement component lazy loading
- **Image Optimization**: Use WebP format when possible
- **Bundle Analysis**: Use `npm run build -- --analyze`
- **Memory Management**: Monitor and optimize memory usage

#### **3D Visualization Performance**
- **Level of Detail**: Implement LOD for complex scenes
- **Texture Optimization**: Compress textures appropriately
- **Geometry Optimization**: Reduce polygon count when possible
- **Frame Rate Monitoring**: Implement FPS monitoring

### **Security Considerations**

#### **Frontend Security**
- **Environment Variables**: Never expose secrets in frontend
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize dynamic content
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens where needed

#### **Backend Security**
- **Row Level Security**: Enable RLS on all Supabase tables
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on functions
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT token handling
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest
