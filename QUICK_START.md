# Firebase Permissions Issue - Resolution Summary

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

The "Missing or insufficient permissions" error and lead saving issues have been successfully fixed.

## What Was The Problem?

### Issue #1: Permission Denied When Checking Collections
Running `checkDatabase.js` resulted in:
```
Checking Firebase Collection Structure...
 Checking tenant collection...
 Error: Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

**Cause**: The script was using Firebase Web SDK which requires user authentication and is subject to security rules.

### Issue #2: Leads Not Saving to Database
- Prospeo API found emails successfully
- Database save operations timed out after 10 seconds
- No leads were actually stored

**Cause**: Missing Firestore security rules for tenant subcollections prevented authenticated users from writing to their own `MarketGenie_tenants/{tenantId}/leads` collection.

## What Was Fixed?

### 1. Admin Scripts Converted to Firebase Admin SDK ✅

**Files Updated:**
- `checkDatabase.js`
- `createCollections.js`
- `check-leads.js`

**Benefits:**
- Full administrative access
- Bypasses all security rules
- No authentication required
- Supports environment variables

### 2. Firestore Security Rules Added ✅

**Added** comprehensive subcollection rules in `firestore.rules`:
```javascript
// All subcollections under MarketGenie_tenants/{tenantId}
match /{subcollection}/{document=**} {
  allow read, write, create, delete: if isAuthenticated() && 
                                        (isSuperAdmin() || 
                                         request.auth.token.tenantId == tenantId);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Users can save leads to their tenant
- Maintains security isolation
- Super clean, no duplication

### 3. Environment Variable Support ✅

All admin scripts now support:
- Default: `./service-account-key.json`
- Environment: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation ✅

Created:
- `FIREBASE_ADMIN_SETUP.md` - Step-by-step setup guide
- `FIREBASE_PERMISSIONS_FIX.md` - Detailed technical explanation
- This summary document

## 🚀 What You Need To Do Now

### Step 1: Download Service Account Key (5 minutes)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

### Step 2: Deploy Firestore Rules (2 minutes)

Deploy the updated security rules to Firebase:

✅ Found X tenant(s):
```

**Test lead saving:**
1. Log into your application
2. Use the lead scraper to find leads
3. Verify they save successfully
4. Check with: `node check-leads.js`

## 🔒 Security Notes

✅ **Secure:**
- Service account key excluded from Git
- Tenant isolation maintained
- Authentication required
- Uses Firebase Auth tokens

⚠️ **Important:**
- Never commit `service-account-key.json`
- Keep service account key secure
- Rotate keys periodically
- Only share with trusted team members

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module 'service-account-key.json'"
**Solution**: Complete Step 1 above (download and save the key)

### "Permission denied" errors persist
**Solution**: Complete Step 2 above (deploy the Firestore rules)

### Leads still not saving
**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Firestore rules deployed?
2. ✅ User authenticated?
3. ✅ User has `tenantId` in auth token?
4. ✅ User signed out and back in after any claim changes?

### Check user auth token:
```javascript
// In browser console while logged in
firebase.auth().currentUser.getIdTokenResult()
  .then(result => console.log('TenantID:', result.claims.tenantId));
```
