# DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR MARKET GENIE

## 🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

### Option 1: Manual Upload (Recommended)
Since the Firebase CLI is having issues, you can manually deploy through the Firebase Console:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/market-genie-f2d41
2. **Navigate to Hosting**: Click "Hosting" in the left sidebar
3. **Upload Files**: Click "Deploy to live channel" or "Get started"
4. **Upload dist folder contents**:
   - Upload ALL files from `d:\A1SASS FILES\Market Geine\dist\`
   - Make sure `index.html` is the main file
   - Upload the entire `assets` folder with all JS/CSS files

### Option 2: ZIP Upload
1. **Create ZIP file** of the `dist` folder contents
2. **Upload ZIP** through Firebase Console hosting interface
3. **Deploy** once uploaded

### Option 3: Try Alternative CLI Commands
```bash
# Try these alternative commands:
firebase hosting:channel:deploy preview --expires 7d
firebase deploy --only hosting --debug
firebase hosting:clone live preview
```
