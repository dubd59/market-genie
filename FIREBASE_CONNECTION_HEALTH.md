This file tracks deployment events that might trigger CORS issues. 

### Last Update: ${new Date().toISOString()}

### Common Triggers:
1. **Firestore Rules Deployment** - `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
2. **Functions Deployment** - `firebase deploy --only functions`  
3. **Hosting Deployment** - `firebase deploy --only hosting`
4. **Full Project Deployment** - `firebase deploy`

### Prevention Measures Implemented:

### Manual Recovery Commands:
If CORS issues persist, run these commands in order:

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Clear Firebase cache
firebase --clear-cache

# 2. Redeploy rules only
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# 3. Force browser cache clear
# Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R

# 4. If still failing, redeploy everything
firebase deploy
\`\`\`

- ‚úÖ "Firebase connection healthy" - All good
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Firebase connection issue detected" - Auto-recovery in progress  
- üîÑ "Comprehensive recovery successful" - Issue resolved
